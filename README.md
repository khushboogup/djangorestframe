### Django REST Framework

**Overview**

Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs. It provides a great deal of functionality out of the box, such as:

* **Model serialization:** Django REST framework can automatically serialize your Django models to and from JSON, XML, and other formats.
* **Authentication and authorization:** Django REST framework includes a variety of authentication and authorization schemes, including token authentication and OAuth2.
* **Filtering and pagination:** Django REST framework provides powerful filtering and pagination capabilities, so that your users can easily find the data they need.
* **Hypermedia support:** Django REST framework supports hypermedia, so that your API clients can easily discover new resources and navigate your API.

Django REST framework is also highly extensible, so that you can customize it to meet your specific needs.

To install Django REST framework, simply run the following command:

You may also want to include the Django REST framework URLs in your project's `urls.py` file:
